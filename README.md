# Android-Mobile-Application--Midterm-Project
Project created during the "Android Mobile Application Develpment" course inside OISE - University of Toronto 

This repository has the source code of my Midterm Project for the <b>SCS_2682_010: Mobile Applications for Android Devices</b>
inside Ontario Institute for Studies in Education - University of Toronto

For the Midterm Project the students had to build an application that show a simple form that when inserted any value opens up a new text field to keep notes in a Recycler View, this Recycler View must save all the notes inserted by the user on shared preferences.

To run the code: download the .zip file or clone the repository on your computer and open the project folder on <b>Android Studio</b>.
